# Search as a Service public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official SAAS public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/valtech-ch/projects/3/views/1)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. 

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas for Search as a Service:

- **Frontend:** Planning and tracking tools (Issues, Projects)
- **Crawler:** The service includes regular or on-demand crawling of content (web pages or documents) via sitemaps (recommended) or by parsing the HTML structures and link tracking. Relevant content is extracted using a variety of selectors and added to the search index along with structured metadata.
- **Admin UI:** The service includes a user interface to define, control and monitor crawler jobs.
- **Infrastructure:** The infrastructure covers the hosting and operations of the service.

The following is a list of our current product areas for Adobe AEM Sites:

- **AEM Module:** The component includes accelerator code for the integration of SAAS search functionalities into Adobe AEM Sites.
